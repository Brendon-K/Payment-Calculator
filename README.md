# Payment-Calculator

https://brendon-k.github.io/Payment-Calculator/

Calculates the final balance for a customer when they receive some kind of discount on their payment. 

The idea behind this came from my mother. At her work customers get a 3.3% discount when they pay by check, meaning that if the customer pays $100.00 by check, then the balance they'll have is $103.41 since 3.3% of $103.41 is $100.
